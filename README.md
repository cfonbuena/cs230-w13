# CS230 - Week 13: Max Heap and Heapsort 

This project showcases basic heap functionality. Only a few methods are implemented: creating a heap, building a max heap, and sorting a heap.

## How to Run / Test

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/cfonbuena/cs230-w13.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd cs230-w13
```

Compile main.cpp
```bash
  g++ main.cpp
```

Run the compiled output
```bash
FOR WINDOWS:
  ./a.exe
  
FOR NON-WINDOWS:
  ./a.out
```


## Expected Output

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
  ** Create heap using given size **
<array of 5 randomly generated values>
Build Max Heap
<array of the random values, where the 1st element is greatest and 2nd is less than or equal to>
Heap Sort
<array of the random values, sorted in ascending order>

** Create heap using given array **
9 1 5 3 7
Build Max Heap
9 7 5 3 1
Heap Sort
1 3 5 7 9
```
